<h1> Sentinel-2 Web-App for rapid analysing of Sentinel data for conflict monitoring </h1>
<h5> by Philipp Glahe </h5>

<p> The high number of violent conflicts and how human rights are abused worldwide during those acts of war require monitoring and
documentation of these conflict areas. This documentation is often hardly possible without dangerous ground-level explorations. 
To avoid this, satellite images are often used nowadays to document and publish possible human rights issues. Satellite images 
provide the possibility to remote the conflict areas as well as visual evidence to support ground reports or human rights violations 
due to their visual overview. This Web-App should faciliate the automated detection and Analysis of conflict areas using Sentinel-2 data</p>

<br>
<p> This Web App was developed as part of my Bachelor Thesis "A tool for rapid Sentinel-2 analysis in confict monitoring"</p> 
<br>

<h2> Dependencies </h2> 
<b> GDAL </b> 
<b> Node </b>
<b> OpenCPU <b>

<h2> Installation </h2>
<p> After Node, Gdal and OpenCPU are installed, the R Package  must be installed on your own server or on the public OpenCPU server.
The R package can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/dwalin93/SENTINEL2Processing"> SENTINEL2Processing Package</a>
After the R package was sucessfully installed, just run <code> npm install </code> and then <code> npm start </code> to run the application.
